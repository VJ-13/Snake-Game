The Snake Game is a classic game implemented in Python with pygame. The development process involved several steps to create a functional and visually appealing game.

## Snake Class
First, the necessary libraries were imported to provide the required functionality. Then, a Snake class was created to handle the game's snake object. This class initialized variables, loaded graphics and sound, and implemented methods for drawing the snake's head and tail, moving the snake, adding blocks to the snake, playing sound effects, and resetting the snake when it dies.

## Fruit Class
Next, a Fruit class was created to handle the game's fruit object. This class initialized variables, loaded graphics, and implemented methods for drawing the fruit and randomizing its position.

## Main Class
A Main class was then created to manage the overall game. This class initialized variables, ran various functions, and handled the game loop. The game loop checked for player input, updated and drew all game elements, checked if the snake's head collided with the fruit, checked if the snake died, and triggered the necessary actions accordingly.
